abstract = "Recently, due to the increasing size of the data matrices, it has become more and more computationally expensive to operate of such matrices. We suggest some additional thoughts as to how to reduce this computational complexity. First, we suggest the possibility of cutting down on the number of projection operation in a normal constrained optimization setting and thereby cutting down on some of the vary taxing operations on matrices. We also indicate the benefits of limitations of this approach Second, we more to a specific notorious constraint i.e. rank constraint. We study the minimization of function $f(X)$ over the set of all $n * m$ matrices when we are supposed to satisfy a constraint rank=r. We propose a algorithm on the lines of Factored Gradient descent (FGD) and show its theoretical convergence and simulation results."
